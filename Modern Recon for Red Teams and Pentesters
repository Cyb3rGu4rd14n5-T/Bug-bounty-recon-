 "Modern Recon for Red Teams and Pentesters," by Jason Haddix,(https://youtu.be/B1YcflQRvOI?si=ydZM38Ixo-3m2A-m) provides a comprehensive overview of advanced reconnaissance techniques for offensive security professionals. Haddix shares insights and tools from his experience in bug bounty hunting and red teaming, emphasizing that modern recon is a non-linear process that requires continuous adaptation and a variety of esoteric methods to succeed (2:10).

Here are the key takeaways from the talk:

Importance of Reconnaissance (1:00-2:09): Reconnaissance is crucial for identifying target hosts, infrastructure, and potential attack surfaces. Finding new apex domains and subdomains significantly increases the chances of a successful attack.

ASN Discovery (4:34-8:40): Haddix highlights the use of bgp.he.net as a reliable tool for finding Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) to identify owned IP space for targets. This helps in mapping out a company's infrastructure.

Tenant Data for Hidden Domains (13:45-16:57): The speaker discusses a method to discover hidden domains using tenant IDs, which was previously possible through a Microsoft API and is now available via a community-maintained script called tenant-domains.sh. This provides a snapshot of domains associated with a target.

Port Scanning Strategies (17:06-21:30): While Nmap is a common tool, Haddix suggests Nmap, Nuclei, and Shodan for faster and more stealthy port scanning. He introduces smap as a tool that wraps around Shodan queries to perform port scans without directly touching the target.

>>TOOLS: nabuu, nmap, smap 

Passive Recon with Shodan (21:40-25:55): Shodan is presented as a powerful tool for passively gathering subdomains, IP addresses, and vulnerability data. Haddix explains how to use Shodan dorking and custom checks (scanner_karma) to identify vulnerable instances like Grafana or open Spring Boot actuators.

Acquisition-Based Recon (25:56-28:12): Tracking company acquisitions through platforms like Traxxin and Pitchbook can reveal new apex domains and expand the attack surface.

SSL Certificate Intelligence & Cloud Enumeration 

(28:13-34:30): Haddix advises against cert.sh due to its limitations and recommends tools like Kaducius for scanning SSL certificates to find cloud IP space, internal domains, and other subdomains. He also mentions Kfer Jagger as a collected dataset for those who don't want to perform the scans themselves.

(34:31-36:41): tracking the new assets with 
Monitoring New Assets with Certificate Transparency  Gungir is introduced as a tool to monitor certificate transparency projects for new domain and subdomain registrations, providing real-time alerts for bug bounty hunters and red teamers.

Subdomain Enumeration at Scale (36:42-49:50): The video emphasizes moving beyond brute-force methods. Subfinder and BBOT are highlighted as predominant tools for subdomain scraping, with BBOT often finding more subdomains. The importance of hooking up API keys from sources like Chaos and Cisco Umbrella into Subfinder is stressed to maximize results.
Practical Workflow 

>>>>TOOLS: subfinder, https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot (brings more domains than subfinder)


Summary (47:37-49:50): Haddix concludes with a one-liner command that integrates Subfinder and HTTPX to automate subdomain enumeration, verify web servers, and output detailed information into CSV files for analysis. This process can be used to build a makeshift Asset Security Management (ASM) system.
