* Endpoint discovery
* Surface mapping
* Misconfiguration identification
* Access control testing preparation
* High-impact vulnerability hunting

This is not limited to one tool or one technique.
It is a continuously evolving recon reference that will expand over time as new methods and workflows are added.

The focus is on:

* Efficiency
* Practical usage
* Real-world applicability
* Bug bounty and VAPT use cases
